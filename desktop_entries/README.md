# Desktop Entries
These are the icons in Gnome when you click the lower bottom left of the 
(default left-handed side) dock. Sometimes when you manually install apps into 
/opt, or the dev forgot to make a desktop icon, here is some info on how to 
generate your own desktop entries.

Follow some of the examples here in this directory (or copy them directly), and
place the desktop entries into `/usr/local/share/applications`. 

Note, apps that automatically take care desktop entries will place them into
 `/usr/share/applications`.
