# Notes on logging
You could put them in `/var/logs` but that's usually just for linux system logs. 
If you put them in `/var/logs/appname`, then it helps to have a link from 
`/home/dletran/appname/logs` -> symlink `/var/logs/appname`

# Separate files or a single big one?

# Log maintainence
If you have a single file, use `logrotate`.

If you have multiple log files, each per run, then creating a cronjob of
something like this would be effective to delete logs older than 30 days.

`find /path/to/logs/ -type f -mtime +30 -name '*.log' -execdir rm -- '{}' \;`
