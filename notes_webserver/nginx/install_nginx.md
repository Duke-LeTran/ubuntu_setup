I'll help you set up Nginx first. Here's a step by step process:

1. First, let's install Nginx:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

2. Check if Nginx is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

3. If it's not running, start it:
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

4. Enable Nginx to start on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

5. Here's a basic Nginx configuration file for a Python web application. This should be placed in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/your_app`:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com;  # Replace with your domain or IP address

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;  # This will be your Gunicorn port
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

6. Create a symbolic link to enable the site:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

7. Test the Nginx configuration:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

8. If the test is successful, reload Nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

You can verify Nginx is working by opening a web browser and visiting your server's IP address or domain name. You should see the default Nginx welcome page.
